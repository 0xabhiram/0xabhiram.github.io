Act 1 – Scene 1: The Origin of the Image

🎙 Narration (On Camera + Voice-Over):

“Before phones and selfies, one man wanted to capture light.
He placed a metal plate near his window and waited for hours.
After eight long hours, the world’s first photograph appeared — small, faded, but real.
Years later, in 1861, the first colour photo was created.
Red, green, and blue light came together, and for the first time, people saw the world in colour.
Then came film cameras.
Then digital cameras.
Then smartphones.
Now, we take billions of photos every single day.
But something new has started.
We no longer just take photos — we create them.
Not with lenses, but with language.
Your words are now your camera.
Your ideas are your light.
And that phone in your hand?
It’s not just a phone anymore — it’s your art studio.”

Act 1 – Scene 2: From Words to Worlds

🎙 Narration (On Camera):

“It’s all about words.
Just words.
If words can tell a story…
can they also paint one?”
